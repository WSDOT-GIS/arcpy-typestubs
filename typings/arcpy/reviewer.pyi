    """ExecuteReviewerBatchJob_Reviewer(reviewer_workspace, session, batch_job_file, {production_workspace}, {analysis_area}, {changed_features}, {production_workspaceversion})

        Runs a Reviewer batch job on a workspace and writes the results to a
        Reviewer session. A Reviewer batch job contains groups of Reviewer
        checks. Checks validate data based on conditions, rules, and spatial
        relationships. Checks also specify sets of features or rows to
        validate and their source workspace. A Reviewer session stores
        information about validation tasks performed by Reviewer checks. This
        information is stored in a table and a dataset in the Reviewer
        workspace.

     INPUTS:
      reviewer_workspace (Workspace):
          The workspace where the Reviewer batch job results will be written.
      session (String):
          The identifier and name for a Reviewer session. The session must exist
          in the Reviewer workspace.
      batch_job_file (File):
          The path to the Reviewer batch job file to be executed.
      production_workspace {Workspace}:
          The enterprise or file geodatabase that contains the features to be
          validated.
      analysis_area {Feature Layer / Extent}:
          Polygon features or an arcpy.Extent object that define the area that
          will be used to build a validation processing area.
      changed_features {Boolean}:
          Specifies the type of features, changed or unchanged, that will be
          validated when the production workspace references data in an
          enterprise geodatabase.

          * CHANGED_FEATURES-Only features that changed from the parent to the
          child version will be validated.

          * ALL_FEATURES-All features in the data referenced by the batch job
          will be validated. This is the default.
      production_workspaceversion {String}:
          The version of the production workspace to be validated by the batch
          job. This is only applicable when the production workspace is an
